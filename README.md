- Interactive animations to enhance the user experience

## Customization

To customize your curriculum, edit the following files:

- `views/index.templ`: Edit to change dependencies as tailwind and for example the language of your web.
- `components/*.templ`: Customise Tailwind CSS styles and add your own animations and edit HTML content according to your personal details
  > **DO NOT EDIT** `<component>_templ.go` files, they will update by their own thanks to air command.
- `main.go`, `vercel/handler.go`, `vercel.json`: Adjust application settings and routes as needed
- `db/`: There's all the info, change it to add your own info. Any change at the struct will have a long domino way impact, **be aware**.
  - `models`: There's the info adapted to use in a docker postgresql gorm database
  - `constants`: There's the info in a go *raw* state.
- `.env`: you will need an env file that matches dns configuration showed at `storage/postgres.go`
